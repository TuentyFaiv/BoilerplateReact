Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown. By using TRADERBOTIC, you acknowledge that you are familiar with these risks and that you are solely responsible for the outcomes of your decisions.
